    "\n",
    "Resource management: When you open a file, the operating system assigns some resources to it, such as a file descriptor. If you don't close the file after using it, these resources will remain allocated, which can lead to resource leaks and potentially cause issues with other programs that need those resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data integrity: If you write data to a file but don't close it, there is a chance that some of the data may not be written to the file properly. This can happen if the operating system's write buffers have not been flushed to disk yet. Closing the file ensures that any buffered data is written to disk before the file is closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "File locking: Some operating systems may not allow a file to be opened by multiple programs at the same time. If you don't close a file, it may remain locked and other programs may not be able to access it."
