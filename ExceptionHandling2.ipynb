    "\n",
    "The Exception class provides a set of attributes and methods that are helpful in creating a custom exception, such as the ability to specify a custom error message, traceback information, and the ability to handle the exception in a specific way. When we inherit from the Exception class, our custom exception also inherits these attributes and methods, making it easier to create and use the custom exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the Exception class as the base class for our custom exception, we ensure that our exception is consistent with other built-in exceptions in Python, making it easier for other developers to understand and use our code. Additionally, by inheriting from the Exception class, we can take advantage of existing exception handling mechanisms in Python, such as the try-except block, to handle our custom exception in a specific way."

    "\n",
    "Keep the try block small: Keep the try block as small as possible to limit the scope of the exceptions. This will make it easier to debug and handle exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use context managers: Use context managers like with statement to handle resources that need to be closed or released after use. This will ensure that the resources are properly cleaned up, even if an exception occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use finally block: Use the finally block to perform cleanup actions that must be executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Log exceptions: Use logging to log the exception traceback and relevant information. This will make it easier to debug the issue and provide information for troubleshooting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reraise exceptions: If you catch an exception and cannot handle it, it is better to reraise the exception instead of silently ignoring it. This will ensure that the exception is properly handled by the calling code."
