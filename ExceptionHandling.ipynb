    "Q1. What is an Exception in python? Write the different between Exceptions and syntax errors?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, an Exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. It typically indicates that something unexpected has happened, such as an invalid input or an operation that cannot be performed. When an Exception is raised, Python will stop executing the current code block and search for an Exception handler to handle the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors, on the other hand, occur when the Python interpreter cannot parse the code due to incorrect syntax. This type of error is usually caught before the code is executed, and it prevents the program from running at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between Exceptions and syntax errors is that Exceptions occur during runtime, while syntax errors occur during the compilation or parsing stage. Another difference is that Exceptions can be caught and handled with try/except blocks, while syntax errors must be fixed before the program can run.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Exceptions are runtime errors that occur during the execution of a program, while syntax errors are errors that occur due to incorrect syntax and prevent the program from running."
